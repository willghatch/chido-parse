Schedulers keep track of parse work that needs to be done.
The job-list can contain:
* parser-jobs, which contain all the info to run a parser and cache its results
* scheduled-continuations, which have an outer job that they represent (or #f for the original outside caller) and a single dependency.
* alt-workers, which are special workers for alt-parsers.  Alt-workers are spawned instead of normal continuations for alt-parsers.

Result cache:
A multi-tier hash of port-broker->parser->extra-args-list->start-position->result-number->result.
The top level of the cache is a weak hash.

cache thunk
- contains all the info to access the cache (or schedule an update to it)
- checks the cache, and if there is a result just return it
- else schedule a new job with the procedure and other cache info and also schedule a the current continuation as a job that depends on the new procedure.  Put the continuation job on the priority stack.  Also if there is a continuation mark denoting that this was done within another job, mark that anti-dependency on the new thunk job.
